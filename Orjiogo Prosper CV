Software Engineer | Fullstack & DevOps Enthusiast I build backend systems so solid you could rest your app’s uptime on them—and now, I also craft frontend experiences that feel buttery smooth. Whether it’s NestJS under the hood or Next.js on the surface, I bring a fullstack mindset to every line of code. I enjoy system design the way some folks enjoy puzzles, give me a messy set of requirements and I’ll architect something that scales, performs, and doesn’t crash when someone presses F5 too hard. And if I don’t know it yet? I’ll learn it faster than you can say “async await” (with types, of course).
 
Experience That Shaped My Engineering Mindset
HNG Internship Program Backend Developer Intern • (1/2025 - 4/2025)
• Contributed to multiple backend projects, implementing RESTful APIs and integrating BaaS solutions like Appwrite, Firebase, and Supabase.
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop scalable backend services using NestJS.
• Demonstrated rapid learning by quickly adapting to new technologies and frameworks as required by project demands.
• Participated in system design discussions and wrote clean, modular code.
• Learned how to debug in the dark (literally—thanks NEPA).
Dream Mesh (Now Nurture Tech) | Lagos Software Engineer (Intern) • 05/2017 - 09/2017
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams to resolve software issues, leading to a 95% uptime improvement.
• Developed object-oriented, scalable web applications, ensuring stability and efficiency.
• Gained hands-on experience in backend architecture and software lifecycle best practices.
• Basically learned how to break less stuff—progress!
Servest Nigeria | Lagos Technician/Network Systems Administrator • 01/2022 - 06/2024
• Configured and maintained network infrastructure, significantly improving operational efficiency.
• Managed Designa access control systems, ensuring seamless security and access control.
• Implemented disaster recovery plans, preventing data loss and ensuring uninterrupted services (because nobody likes unexpected downtime).
• Conducted audits to ensure compliance, earning recognition from regulatory bodies (basically, I made the rules work for us).
• Became the go-to troubleshooter—if something broke, I fixed it. If it didn’t break, I still kept an eye on it, just in case. 
Personal & Freelance Projects Frontend & Fullstack Development • Ongoing
• Built and deployed fullstack applications using React, Next.js, and NestJS—the holy trinity of modern web development (in my toolbox, at least).
• collaborating on hng_boilerplate_nestjs and developing eLearningTempah to demonstrate backend architecture, route handling, and API design using NestJS and Express.
• Created Tempah_Banking, a fullstack TypeScript project built with Next.js, showcasing both frontend logic and server-side capabilities, including API integration and user authentication.
• Built firebaseapp to explore real-time data handling and authentication using Firebase, proving that serverless doesn’t mean soulless.
• Integrated BaaS solutions like Appwrite, Firebase, and Supabase to move fast without reinventing the backend wheel.
• Leveraged server-side rendering and API routes in Next.js to build fast, SEO-friendly, production-grade apps.
• Designed systems that actually make sense (yes, I’m into system design and yes, I enjoy it).
• Styled user interfaces with Tailwind CSS and material UI—because nobody likes apps that look like 2012.
